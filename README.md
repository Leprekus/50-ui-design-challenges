# 50 Daily UI Design Challenges
-----------------------------------------
The aim of this project is to design 50 daily UI interfaces. The concept is simple, but at the end I will feel more comfortable with the layout of simple pages as well as the tricks that I will learn along the way. 

Furthermore, while not always I will try to follow different Design System Guidelines as consistently as possible. In order to be able to output higher quality frontend designs faster.
